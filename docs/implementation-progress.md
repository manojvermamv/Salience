# Implementation Progress

## Active Context

- Branch: `phases-1-4-foundation`
- Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-12-phases-1-4-foundation.md`
- Active task: 2 — canonical PostgreSQL model and migrations
- Current TDD step: checkpoint Task 2, then write the focused governance-service tests for Task 3.
- Last verified state: initial Alembic migration, canonical schema checks, and monotonic audit trigger pass against live PostgreSQL.

## Checkpoints

- 2026-09-12: Created the isolated worktree and installed the local test runner.
- 2026-09-12: Added and verified the failing configuration-security test; implementation has not started.
- 2026-09-12: Completed dependency research and recorded ADRs; SeaweedFS was rejected for an unpatched high advisory and Garage selected as the isolated S3 service.
- 2026-09-12: Implemented the validated settings model, pinned initial dependencies/images, passed the configuration test and Compose validation, and built the Python 3.13 image.
- 2026-09-12: Completed and committed the deployable runtime scaffold, then observed the focused PostgreSQL migration test fail before migration implementation.
- 2026-09-12: Implemented immutable canonical PostgreSQL migration and matching typed models; verified required identity, governance, provenance, scheduling, idempotency, trace, and secret-reference schema invariants against live PostgreSQL.

## Resume Instructions

1. Start Task 3 by writing failing unit tests for policy evaluation, scoped secret resolution, budget reservations, and OpenTelemetry-compatible trace propagation.
2. Build governance behavior on canonical records; never persist raw secret values.
3. Update this file and the checked task steps after each verified slice, then commit the checkpoint.
