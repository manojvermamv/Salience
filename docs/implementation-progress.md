# Implementation Progress

## Active Context

- Branch: `phases-1-4-foundation`
- Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-12-phases-1-4-foundation.md`
- Active task: 2 — canonical PostgreSQL model and migrations
- Current TDD step: implement owned object-storage and plugin registry contracts for the red conformance suite.
- Last verified state: storage and plugin contract tests fail during collection because their contract modules do not exist.

## Checkpoints

- 2026-09-12: Created the isolated worktree and installed the local test runner.
- 2026-09-12: Added and verified the failing configuration-security test; implementation has not started.
- 2026-09-12: Completed dependency research and recorded ADRs; SeaweedFS was rejected for an unpatched high advisory and Garage selected as the isolated S3 service.
- 2026-09-12: Implemented the validated settings model, pinned initial dependencies/images, passed the configuration test and Compose validation, and built the Python 3.13 image.
- 2026-09-12: Completed and committed the deployable runtime scaffold, then observed the focused PostgreSQL migration test fail before migration implementation.
- 2026-09-12: Implemented immutable canonical PostgreSQL migration and matching typed models; verified required identity, governance, provenance, scheduling, idempotency, trace, and secret-reference schema invariants against live PostgreSQL.
- 2026-09-12: Completed and committed the canonical database Task 2 checkpoint, then created the four focused red governance contracts for policy, costs, secrets, and tracing.
- 2026-09-12: Implemented deterministic governance controls and repaired an installed OpenTelemetry trace-flag compatibility mismatch; all six focused governance tests pass.
- 2026-09-12: Completed and committed the Task 3 governance checkpoint, then created red conformance tests for memory/S3 object stores and versioned plugin registration.

## Resume Instructions

1. Implement Task 4's owned storage, workflow, and plugin contracts plus memory/S3 adapters and registry until conformance tests pass.
2. Keep integrations behind owned contracts and keep governance behavior provider-neutral.
3. Update this file and the checked task steps after each verified slice, then commit the checkpoint.
