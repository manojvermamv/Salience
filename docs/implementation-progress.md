# Implementation Progress

## Active Context

- Branch: `phases-1-4-foundation`
- Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-12-phases-1-4-foundation.md`
- Active task: 2 — canonical PostgreSQL model and migrations
- Current TDD step: implement the Temporal-backed dummy workflow and mock-effect reconciliation for the red restart verifier.
- Last verified state: pinned Temporal auto-setup is running with the default namespace; the focused restart test fails because workflow services do not exist.

## Checkpoints

- 2026-09-12: Created the isolated worktree and installed the local test runner.
- 2026-09-12: Added and verified the failing configuration-security test; implementation has not started.
- 2026-09-12: Completed dependency research and recorded ADRs; SeaweedFS was rejected for an unpatched high advisory and Garage selected as the isolated S3 service.
- 2026-09-12: Implemented the validated settings model, pinned initial dependencies/images, passed the configuration test and Compose validation, and built the Python 3.13 image.
- 2026-09-12: Completed and committed the deployable runtime scaffold, then observed the focused PostgreSQL migration test fail before migration implementation.
- 2026-09-12: Implemented immutable canonical PostgreSQL migration and matching typed models; verified required identity, governance, provenance, scheduling, idempotency, trace, and secret-reference schema invariants against live PostgreSQL.
- 2026-09-12: Completed and committed the canonical database Task 2 checkpoint, then created the four focused red governance contracts for policy, costs, secrets, and tracing.
- 2026-09-12: Implemented deterministic governance controls and repaired an installed OpenTelemetry trace-flag compatibility mismatch; all six focused governance tests pass.
- 2026-09-12: Completed and committed the Task 3 governance checkpoint, then created red conformance tests for memory/S3 object stores and versioned plugin registration.
- 2026-09-12: Implemented and verified owned storage, workflow, and plugin contracts with memory and mocked-S3 adapter coverage; Garage v2.3 command/configuration surface was inspected before wiring a real runtime adapter.
- 2026-09-12: Completed and committed Task 4; started the pinned Temporal runtime and observed the red process-restart verifier fail before any workflow implementation.

## Resume Instructions

1. Implement Task 5's Temporal-backed dummy workflow and independent mock effect reconciliation until the real restart verifier passes.
2. Keep external effects idempotent at both local and provider boundaries, with durable checkpointing before every boundary.
3. Update this file and the checked task steps after each verified slice, then commit the checkpoint.
